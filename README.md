# ZenUML/Core
ZenUML is JavaScript-based diagramming tool that requires **no server**. It uses Markdown-inspired text definitions
and a renderer to create and modify sequence diagrams. The main purpose of ZenUML is to
help documentation catch up with development.

ZenUML allows even non-programmers to easily create beautiful sequence diagrams through
the [ZenUML Live Editor](https://app.zenuml.com).

You can use it ZenUML on your favorite platforms and applications:
* [Confluence](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1218380/zenuml-diagrams-for-confluence-freemium?hosting=cloud&tab=overview)
* [Web App](https://app.zenuml.com/)
* [JetBrains Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12437-zenuml-support)
* [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenuml-sequence/kcpganeflmhffnlofpdmcjklmdpbbmef)

# Integrations

ZenUML can be integrated with your favorite tools and platforms as a library or an embeddable widget.
Please follow the [integration guide](./docs/asciidoc/integration-guide.adoc) for detailed steps.

# Development

````
yarn install
yarn start
````

## CI/CD
CI/CD is done with GitHub Actions. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/*.yml`.

## gh-pages.yml
This workflow has two jobs: `build` -> `deploy`.

````text
test  -> npm publish 
      -> cy tests
      -> build site -> deploy gh-pages
````

This workflow is triggered on every push to the `main` branch. 
It will build the project and publish the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.


## Put localhost on the internet
We sometimes need to put our localhost on the internet so that we can test it remotely.

Ngrok is a good tool for this. It is free for personal use. But if you want to use a
custom domain, you have to pay. If you want to use custom domain, we suggest Cloudflare
tunnels for this.

### Ngrok [TODO]

### Cloudflare tunnels [for collaborators only]

1. Start your local dev server at `8080` with `pnpm dev`.
2. Request a subdomain from the team. For example, `air.zenuml.com`.
3. You will be given a command that install a service locally. Run it.
4. Your localhost:8080 will be available at `air.zenuml.com`.

# Code Structure
This repository contains both the DSL parser and the renderer.

The parser is generated with Antlr4. You can find the definition at `src/g4`. Generated parser is at `src/generated-parser`. 
Parser enhancement with customised functionalities is in the `src/parser` folder.

Almost everything else under serc are for the renderer. The render is based on VueJs 2.x.

The building version of node must be v14. The latest version of node is not supported.
