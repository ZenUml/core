# Development

````
yarn install
yarn start
````

## CI/CD
CI/CD is done with GitHub Actions. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/*.yml`.

## gh-pages.yml
This workflow has two jobs: `build` -> `deploy`.

````text
test  -> npm publish 
      -> cy tests
      -> build site -> deploy gh-pages
````

This workflow is triggered on every push to the `main` branch. 
It will build the project and publish the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.


## Put localhost on the internet
We sometimes need to put our localhost on the internet so that we can test it remotely.

Ngrok is a good tool for this. It is free for personal use. But if you want to use a
custom domain, you have to pay. If you want to use custom domain, we suggest Cloudflare
tunnels for this.

### Ngrok [TODO]

### Cloudflare tunnels [for collaborators only]

1. Request a subdomain from the team. For example, `air.zenuml.com`.
2. You will be given a command that install a service locally. Run it.
3. Your localhost:8080 will be available at `air.zenuml.com`.
4. Add your subdomain to `vue.config.js` so that it is allowed to access the dev server.

```js
devServer: {
  allowedHosts: "all",
      historyApiFallback: true,
      hot: true,
      host: '0.0.0.0',
      port: 8080,
      client: {
    webSocketURL: 'auto://0.0.0.0:0/ws',
  }
}
```

# Integration
An important goal of this project is to be easily integrated into other projects.
There are mainly two ways to do this.

## As a library [TODO]

## As an iframe
To test this out open `https://embed.zenuml.com/embed.html`. In the developer console, type in the
following command.

```js
window.postMessage( {action: 'eval', args: { script: ['ZenUML.Hello'] }})
```
### The protocol

The protocol is a simple JSON object with the following fields.
```json
{
  "action": "eval",
  "args": {
    "code": "ZenUML.Hello",
    "style": "#diagram { background-color: red; }", 
    "theme": "blue",
    "css": "https://github.com/abruzzi/zenuml-css-overrides/blob/master/zenuml-override.css"
  }
}
```

### Example
```js
document.getElementsByTagName('iframe')[0] // get iframe
    .contentWindow  // get target window
    .postMessage({action: "eval", args: { code: 'A.m' }})
```
# Code Structure
This repository contains both the DSL parser and the renderer.

The parser is generated with Antlr4. You can find the definition at `src/g4`. Generated parser is at `src/generated-parser`. 
Parser enhancement with customised functionalities is in the `src/parser` folder.

Almost everything else under serc are for the renderer. The render is based on VueJs 2.x.
