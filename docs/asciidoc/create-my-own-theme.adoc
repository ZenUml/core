= Creat my own theme

Since the elements on the rendered diagram is based on HTML Dom (and svg), it is simple
to create your own theme. There is a repository on GitHub that have some themes collected
by third party. You may be able to get some inspiration from there. https://github.com/abruzzi/zenuml-css-overrides

== The Information Architecture

The diagram is rendered in two layers. The back layer is the lifeline layer. The front layer
is the message layer.

Key information on the diagram can be grouped in the following structure:

Text messages are internally styled at four levels:

1. text-skin-base: used for all messages
2. text-skin-muted: used for comments
3. text-skin-link: used for links
4. text-skin-secondary: used for everything else, such as title, participant, divider notes, etc.

Each of the elements has a semantic selector that can be used to customize the appearance.

The component has basic styling in itself mostly to support layout and positioning. Then
the core renderer comes with a default theme that defines the appearance of the elements.

== What can a theme change?

A theme can change two aspects of the diagram:

1. colors
2. slightly change the layout (e.g. padding, margin, etc.). For example, you can make the
diagram more compact by reducing the padding.

== where can I apply themes

You can apply themes on the follow products:

. JetBrains plugins (Intellij IDEA, WebStore, PhpStore, etc.)
. https://app.zenuml.com

With https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-css/okpjlejfhacmgjkmknjhadmkdbcldfcb[User CSS]
browser extension, you can apply themes anywhere (e.g. https://zenuml.cn).

== Principles of creating themes

=== 1. Do not override tailwind classes
The tailwind classes directly applied on the elements are important for layout so
they are NOT meant be overridden.

For example,
[html]
....
// Participant.vue
<div class="participant relative flex flex-col justify-center z-10 h-10"
....

=== 2. Use provided class selectors
Important elements are provided with a semantic class selector. You can use them
to override the style.

For the above example, the class selector is `participant`. You can override the
style by using this selector.

[css]
....
// use `.zenuml .sequence-diagram` to increase specificity
.zenuml .sequence-diagram .participant {
  background-color: #f00;
}
....

=== 3. Debug your theme

You can use the browser extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-css/okpjlejfhacmgjkmknjhadmkdbcldfcb[User CSS]
